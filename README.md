**Introduction:**

With the evolution of technologies in the last few decades, gaming industry has gone a long way. Humans have jumped from a few first games ever in the late 80s to a massive gaming library like nowadays. Large amount of games means it costs more to produce physical discs to sell. That is also the reason why many publishers have moved from discs to online codes. It is more efficiency and costs less. Understanding the trend and the needs of people, we have created a website that acts as an intermediate gateway to all the publishers. This webpages will allow people, especially gamers, to buy online key code across multiple publishers at the lowest price.
